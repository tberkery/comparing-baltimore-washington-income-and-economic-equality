## Procedure
1. Download all data from raw data sets in this repository (or from https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), and open the raw data files in Microsoft Excel.
1. Copy and paste all data from into a single spreadsheet. Create a column called While doing so, create a column called "category" and note the group (e.g. Opportunity Atlas-defined child race) associated with the data you are pasting.
1. Create a column called "cty_Category Key" and locate this column so it is the leftmost column in the spreadsheet. Use the concatenate formula to have the value of each cell in this column be the "cty" value plus an underscore ("_") plus the "category" with one exception: if your current record is not specific to an Opportunity Atlas-defined child race group (i.e. it's general to an entire county), only concatenate an underscore prior to the "cty" value. This will be important later when we sort prior to utilizing a VLOOKUP formula.
1. Create two columns to the right of the "cty_Category Key" to with the headers "Economic Income/Equality Score" and "Categorical Variance" at the top.
1. Immediately to the right of the two columns you just created, insert one column for each Opportunity Atlas-defined childhood race category and list the key exactly as you listed it in the "category" column you created in Step 2 as the header.
1. Create two columns to the right of the columns you just created: one with the header "Relative County Score" and the next with the headline "Baseline County Score" at the top.
1. Create a column titled "categorical variance" that we will use later.
1. Devise a baseline county score of interest based off household income, employment rate, high school graduation rate, college graduation rate, and percent of adults staying in the same commuting zone. Check out [my spreadsheet] (https://github.com/tberkery/comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality/blob/main/Comparing%20Baltimore%20and%20Washington%20D.C.%20Income%20and%20Economic%20Equality.xlsx) for the specific formulas I used for all steps from here on out.
1. Devise a way to rank counties relative to reach other. Again, see [my spreadsheet] (https://github.com/tberkery/comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality/blob/main/Comparing%20Baltimore%20and%20Washington%20D.C.%20Income%20and%20Economic%20Equality.xlsx) for the specific formula I used.
1. In each of the category-based columns you created in Step 5, calculate the relative county score for each specific group. Again, see [my spreadhseet] (https://github.com/tberkery/comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality/blob/main/Comparing%20Baltimore%20and%20Washington%20D.C.%20Income%20and%20Economic%20Equality.xlsx) for the specific formula I used. Note that if you use a VLOOKKUP formula like I did that you will need to sort the leftmost column (which should contain your VLOOKUP key) in ascending alphabetical order.
1. Populate the "categorical variance" column using the VAR.S formula to compute the variance across the group-specific relative county scores you computed in the previous step.
1. Devise a way to use the "categorical variance" and "relative county score" columns to calculate the overall "Economic Income/Equality Score" value. Again, see [my spreadsheet] (https://github.com/tberkery/comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality/blob/main/Comparing%20Baltimore%20and%20Washington%20D.C.%20Income%20and%20Economic%20Equality.xlsx) for the specific formula I used.
1. Create a PIVOT table and PIVOT chart to visualize your results.
