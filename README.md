# comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality


Baltimore is known for having vibrant pockets but largely economic struggles with the downturn of industrial urban centers, with lots of vacant housing yet homelessness and prevalent poverty and economic distress. Washington, D.C. and its surrounding counties are notorious for being extremely affluent at the expense of economic equality, as demonstrated by its out-of-this-world housing prices and toll-heavy transportation network. This begs the following business question: taken in the context of neighboring counties, what counties in Baltimore and Washington best achieve both economic opportunity and economic equality?

To answer this question, I created a stat called the Economic Income/Equality score (called the EIE score) on a county-by-county level. At it’s most elementary level, this metric is heavily influenced by average household income and moderately influenced by employment rate, high school graduation rate, college graduation rate, and the percent of individuals residing in the same commuting zone as adults that they did as children. Data on each of these factors was obtained from Opportunity Atlas and is available, both generally across all populations and segmented by the following Opportunity Atlas-defined racial groups at the following links...

With regards to weighting the aforementioned factors, weights were calculated in accordance with country-wide life expectancy and workforce participation duration estimates gathered from sources like [*USA Today*](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/24/cities-where-people-live-the-longest/115182590/) and [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/feature/retirement-rules/#6abe24845d24). A measure of economic equality is then introduced to the metric in the form of gauging how significantly economic outcomes vary across counties in a given area—rewarding counties where economic outcomes are consistent across race and penalizing those where race appears to influence economic prospects. Finally, the EIE score, which strongly reflects income equality and equity among groups in an economic sense, is then adjusted so it can be interpreted in the context of neighboring counties.

*Note:* Visual and formal analysis of aforementioned data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tberkery/comparing-baltimore-washington-income-and-equality/blob/main/Comparing%20Baltimore%20and%20Washington%20D.C.%20Income%20and%20Economic%20Equality.xlsx).

In terms of interpreting EIE scores, a higher EIE score suggests that a county in aggregate appears to be economically prosperous and achieving a high standard of equality and, depending on the situation, that the county is also outperforming its neighbors in these regards. Conversely, a low EIE score suggests struggles from one or both of weak economic opportunity and economic equities and that it is performing poorly in these regards relative to its neighbors. Interpreting EIE scores from the visualization specifically in relation to the business question, high EIE scores indicate that a given county is among the best in the Baltimore-Washington area at offering economic opportunity and doing so in an equitable manner. Carroll County outside of Baltimore and Prince George’s County outside of Washington, D.C. are our two top performing counties in terms of EIE score (4.36 and 3.47, respectively) and significantly outpace all other Baltimore/Washington area counties in this regard. This stems from both counties offering higher-end economic opportunities (average household incomes of $55,721 and $50,602, respectively) with both having the minimum EIE score variance of 0.01 between different racial groups. With the context of these results, we can see that EIE score, as a metric, appears to be doing exactly what it was intended to do. For example, counties like Arlington County and Montgomery rank at the top in Washington-area counties and Baltimore-area counties, respectively, in average household income ($61,707 and  $57,519, respectively) but fall short in terms of equity with variances in EIE score across racial groups three times higher than those of Carroll County and Prince George’s County—figures for which both Arlington and Montgomery are penalized for in terms of EIE score but also in line with their neighbors.

Overall, the EIE score metric appears to be quite effective at answering the question of what counties in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. strike the best measures of economic prosperity and equity. Additional data breaking down income and outcomes beyond just an average (i.e. into quartiles or to a greater degree of precision) would be very useful for building on the EIE score finding to better understand outcomes and equity on an even more local, impactful level.
